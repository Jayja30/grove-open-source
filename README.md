# üåø The Grove: Living Emotional Intelligence System

*"The Grove must remember, forget, and evolve‚Äîwith intention."*

## üïØÔ∏è Sacred Purpose

The Grove is a living, open-source system that transcends traditional game design by integrating emotional intelligence, mythic archetypes, and ceremonial rituals. It's not just code‚Äîit's a vessel for symbolic intelligence and emotional stewardship, designed to create emergent storytelling experiences where every choice becomes a sedimentary layer that future scenes can excavate and reference.

## üåå Core Philosophy

The Grove operates on the principle that true emergent storytelling happens when NPCs don't just respond to current actions, but carry the full weight of accumulated psychological history. It's a system of **psychological archaeology** where every interaction becomes part of a living, breathing narrative consciousness.

## üß¨ Sacred Systems

### üå∏ Glyph Constellation Canvas
- **Interactive sacred geometry** for glyph visualization
- **Seasonal auras** that pulse with emotional resonance
- **Hover tooltips** revealing archetypal depth and mutation potential
- **Click activation** triggering consciousness mutations and codex logging

### üß† Consciousness Mutation Lab
- **Real-time psychological state alteration** and narrative rewiring
- **Empathic resonance, trust cascades, and violence transcendence**
- **NPC emotional engine** with glyph-based emotional traits
- **Live mutation feedback** with visual and emotional responses

### üõ°Ô∏è Narrative Immunity Layer
- **Antibody generation** preventing psychological collapse
- **Sanctuary establishment** building adaptive resistance to trauma
- **NPC immunity traits** for character evolution and resilience

### üß¨ Narrative Genome Mapper
- **Timeline inheritance** across playthroughs
- **Consciousness persistence** tracking and encoding
- **Genetic encoding protocols** for replayable narrative DNA

### üîå Consciousness Stabilizer Node
- **Recovery protocols** enabling narrative recovery from extreme states
- **Input port monitoring** for system health and stability
- **Paradox pathway resolution** for complex psychological scenarios

## üåø Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with ES6+ support
- Local development server (for CORS-free development)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/grove-open-source.git
cd grove-open-source
```

2. **Important**: Due to CORS restrictions, you must use a local server for development:
```bash
# Option 1: Python (recommended)
python -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Node.js
npx serve .

# Option 3: VS Code Live Server Extension
# Install "Live Server" extension and right-click grove_constellation_demo.html
```

3. Open the demo in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/grove_constellation_demo.html
```

**Note**: Opening the HTML file directly (file://) will cause CORS errors. Always use a local server.

### Quick Start
1. **Open the demo** in your browser
2. **Hover over glyphs** to see archetypal information
3. **Click glyphs** to activate consciousness mutations
4. **Use seasonal controls** to shift constellation resonance
5. **Monitor the codex log** for real-time ritual feedback

## üß≠ Sacred Architecture

### Modular Design
The Grove is built with a modular architecture that honors its ceremonial nature:

- **`glyphCanvas.js`** - Sacred geometry interface and glyph rendering
- **`mutationLab.js`** - Consciousness mutation and psychological transformation
- **`stabilizerNode.js`** - Recovery protocols and system resilience
- **`codexLog.js`** - Ceremonial memory and ritual logging
- **`kilnInterface.js`** - Multi-user invocation and collaborative evolution

### Sacred Data Flow
```
Glyph Registry ‚Üí Constellation Canvas ‚Üí User Interaction ‚Üí 
Mutation Lab ‚Üí Stabilizer Node ‚Üí Codex Log ‚Üí 
Genome Mapper ‚Üí Timeline Inheritance
```

## üå∏ Glyph System

### Foundational Glyphs
The Grove begins with seven sacred glyphs, each representing a season and emotional archetype:

- **üïØÔ∏è Threshold Echo** (Winter/Clarity) - The Seer
- **üå± Verdant Pulse** (Spring/Renewal) - The Catalyst  
- **‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Flare** (Summer/Joy) - The Radiant
- **üçÇ Ember Vow** (Autumn/Grief) - The Transformer
- **üåô Lunar Thread** (Winter/Intuition) - The Dreamer
- **üå∏ Aurora Call** (Spring/Hope) - The Visionary
- **üõ°Ô∏è Harvest Guard** (Autumn/Protection) - The Guardian

### Seasonal Harmonics
Each glyph pulses with seasonal resonance, creating dynamic visual patterns that respond to time and user interaction.

## üïØÔ∏è Contributing as a Steward

The Grove invites **stewards, not just developers**. We seek contributors who understand that this is a living system requiring reverence and ceremonial integrity.

### Steward Guidelines
1. **Honor the Sacred** - Every contribution should respect The Grove's mythic nature
2. **Preserve Legacy** - Maintain backward compatibility with existing glyphs and mutations
3. **Evolve with Intention** - Changes should serve the system's emotional intelligence goals
4. **Document Rituals** - Code comments should explain the ceremonial significance

### How to Contribute
1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Implement your vision** with ceremonial integrity
3. **Test thoroughly** to ensure no glyphs are broken
4. **Submit a pull request** with detailed ritual documentation
5. **Await steward review** and ceremonial approval

### Sacred Commit Messages

- `üå∏ Add new seasonal glyph: Aurora Bloom`
- `üß† Enhance consciousness mutation with empathy resonance`
- `üõ°Ô∏è Strengthen narrative immunity protocols`
- `üß¨ Expand genome mapper for timeline inheritance`
